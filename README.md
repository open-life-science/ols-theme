# Ols Theme Documentation

## Welcome!
This is the documentation for ols-theme, a customisable Jekyll theme developed for [OLS](https://openlifesci.org/). It provides a consistent and professional look for all websites connected to the organisation.

## Getting Started

To use `ols-theme` in your Jekyll project, follow these steps:

### Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "ols-theme"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: ols-theme
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ols-theme
    

### Development

To see if the installation has been done correctly, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server to enable you preview the site.
